# Springboot-User-Management-REST-Service
A backend project which has the functionality to perform CRUD operations by hitting the rest end points. <br>
I have also implemented swagger-ui into the application and the end points are secured using the spring security.
<br>
We can use a client to consume the rest api and perform user login and registration and also manage the users all in one place.
